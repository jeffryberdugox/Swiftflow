A modern, declarative **node-based editor framework** for **SwiftUI**. Build interactive flowcharts, diagrams, and visual programming tools for macOS.

> Inspired by [React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/), SwiftFlow brings professional node graph editing to the Swift ecosystem with a native SwiftUI API.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Declarative API** — Built entirely with SwiftUI for seamless integration
- **Interactive Nodes** — Drag, resize, multi-select with keyboard shortcuts
- **Flexible Edges** — Bezier, SmoothStep, and Straight paths with custom markers
- **Three-Space Coordinates** — Predictable positioning that eliminates common bugs
- **Command Pattern** — Full undo/redo support for all operations
- **Interactive MiniMap** — Bird's-eye view with navigation
- **Helper Lines** — Snap-to-align with visual guides and haptic feedback
- **Zero Dependencies** — Lightweight and easy to integrate

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```swift
import SwiftUI
import SwiftFlow

struct MyNode: FlowNode, Codable {
    let id: UUID
    var position: CGPoint
    var width: CGFloat = 200
    var height: CGFloat = 100
    
    var inputPorts: [any FlowPort] {
        [BasicPort(id: UUID(), position: .left)]
    }
    var outputPorts: [any FlowPort] {
        [BasicPort(id: UUID(), position: .right)]
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var nodes: [MyNode] = []
    @State private var edges: [BasicEdge] = []
    
    var body: some View {
        CanvasView(nodes: $nodes, edges: $edges) { node, isSelected in
            Text("Node")
                .frame(width: node.width, height: node.height)
                .background(Color.white)
                .cornerRadius(8)
        }
        .onConnectionCreated { s, sp, t, tp in
            edges.append(BasicEdge(
                id: UUID(),
                sourceNodeId: s,
                sourcePortId: sp,
                targetNodeId: t,
                targetPortId: tp
            ))
        }
    }
}
```

## 📦 Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Add SwiftFlow to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/jeffryberdugox/SwiftFlow.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

Or in Xcode:
1. File → Add Package Dependencies
2. Enter: `https://github.com/jeffryberdugox/SwiftFlow`
3. Add to your target

---

## 📚 Documentation

SwiftFlow uses **Swift-DocC** for interactive, Xcode-integrated documentation.

## 🎯 Use Cases

SwiftFlow is perfect for building:

- **Flowchart Editors** — Create visual workflow and process diagram applications
- **Node Graph Editors** — Build shader editors, material designers, or blueprint systems
- **Visual Programming Tools** — Develop no-code/low-code environments with drag-and-drop logic
- **Diagram Applications** — Flowcharts, mind maps, UML diagrams, and organization charts
- **Data Flow Visualizers** — ETL pipeline builders and data processing tools
- **State Machine Designers** — Visual finite state machine editors
- **Audio/Video Processing** — Node-based effect chains and signal routing

---

## 💡 Core Concepts

SwiftFlow is built around three key protocols:

- **`FlowNode`** — Nodes in your graph (position, size, ports)
- **`FlowEdge`** — Connections between nodes
- **`FlowPort`** — Connection points on nodes

Everything else is built on top of these simple primitives.

## 🙏 Acknowledgments

SwiftFlow was heavily inspired by and built upon the excellent work of the open-source community.

### Primary Inspirations

SwiftFlow wouldn't exist without the incredible work of these projects:

- **[React Flow](https://reactflow.dev/)** — A heartfelt thank you to the React Flow team for pioneering accessible node-based editors on the web. Your elegant API design, thoughtful coordinate system architecture, and battle-tested interaction patterns served as the foundation for SwiftFlow's approach. We learned so much from studying your implementation.

Thank you for making your work open source and for building a community where others can learn and grow. 💙
